  The sforce_connect.xla is an Add-In and not intended to be opened directly by clicking on the XLA file.

To Install the XLA file into Excel:
  # Launch Excel
  # Click on the Tools menu bar
  # Click on -> Add-Ins...
  # Click on the Browse button, locate the Add-In file from the directory where you unpacked the ZIP file
  # select the add-in and click OK to load it.

When the Add-In is loaded you may see a message about Macro Security, you must have a security setting which will allow you to run Macros to access the functionality in the Force.com Excel Connector.

If the Connector menu bar appears, then the install is complete and you are ready to access the Force.com API
